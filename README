Wiki[http://wiki.github.com/takaltoo/rspec_w3c_matchers] | RDocs[http://rdoc.info/projects/takaltoo/rspec_w3c_matchers]

RspecW3cMatchers provides custom matchers for detecting validation errors reported by 
{w3c validator service}[http://validator.w3.org]. The {w3c_validator gem}[https://github.com/alexdunae/w3c_validators] by
{alexdunae}[https://github.com/alexdunae]. The matchers return detailed information regarding errors or warnings that are 
returned by the w3c validator.

== Installation

In <b>Rails 3</b>, add this to your Gemfile:
    gem "flickrmocks"

Alternatively, you can install it as a plugin:
    rails plugin install git://github.com/takaltoo/rspec_w3c_matchers.git

== Getting Started
RspecW3cMatchers API helpers expect the FlickRaw.api_key to be initialized before they are called:
    FlickRaw.api_key = your_flickr_api_key

== Using the matchers
RspecW3cMatchers::Api.photo(options_hash), returns object of class RspecW3cMatchers::Photo.
The options accepted include:
    :photo_id => "id for photo"
    :secret => "secret for photo"

== Questions or Problems?

If you have any issues with RspecW3cMatchers which you cannot find the solution to in the documentation,
please add an issue on GitHub[http://github.com/takaltoo/rspec_w3c_matchers/issues] or fork the project 
and send a pull request. 

To get the specs running you should call +bundle+ and then +rake+.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I do not break it 
  in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself 
  I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request.
